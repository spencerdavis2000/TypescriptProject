# README
This is simply a typescript project built from scratch to understand
- Actually writing the code and seeing what happens
- Also to put it in a project like format.  Doing it this way allows you to organize things better both in terms of making mulitple files and folders, but also with compiling things which is what the tsconfig.json file is used for

# Things to add little by little
- expressjs to the project would be nice
- angularjs for the front end would also be nice if it is possible to have an angularjs project using typescript

# There is something really nice about being able to build a project from scratch without the use of the cli
